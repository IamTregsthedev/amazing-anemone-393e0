## What is Design

Design is everything!
If you could ask Steve Jobs why design was so important he would probably say it's fundamental to the success of Apple - because designing something isn't just to show-off something that looks pretty but instead, it shows you that people have thought about what they have created.
Likewise, when you design a product, a landing page or a book, you need to think of how your users are going to use it. The focus is on users. Sometimes you have to give them what they want, other times you have to show them what they want. It's a very complicated concept and I think there are hundreds of books out there who are trying to explain what design is.

## Why is design Important
There are two groups of thought: One group is the craigslist group, they totally don't care about design but instead they focus more on usability and features. Then there is a group that is Apple or Stripe inspired. They want things to look and feel amazing, they put thousands of engineering hours into making sure everything is taken into consideration. They probably have some secret framework to do that, but the ultimate goal is to show off a design that will WOW people and that will WOW them again when they've got it in their hands. Whether it's a phone, a laptop, a landing page or a SaaS platform design is important. 
The question is: Are you more of an Apple or a Craigslist person?


## Why Landing Pages are Imporant
Landing pages are extremely important because they're the 2nd thing you will build after you have an idea.
The first thing is to build a list of people who want to buy your idea.
A landing page has a purpose: converting audience to customers.
A landing page is different from a home page because it's more targeted at your audience, you can have many landing pages but you will always have only one homepage.

To let your audience buy your idea, you need - in today's time and age - a landing page. In a landing page you can talk to your users and address their concern and explain why your idea is a world-class BEST solution for their issues. If you can convince people that you've got it all covered, or at least the fundamentals, you can charge a price and they WILL buy it. The problem is that most people don't know how to explain what they're building, or they have not found an audience of people to talk to. With a landing page you can build the first step of trust between you and your audience.
The most important thing about landing pages is that they need to be designed in a way that makes your audience want to convert. Whatever your conversion goal is, that is up to you!

 ## How Good Design Helps your porduct
Designing a great product landing page is necessary because it is extremely important to be able to communicate with your audience.
The biggest problem makers find is that building an audience is extremely difficult, there are hundreds of channels from which you can start peeling off users to build an audience.
However if you have a crappy landing page, designed poorly and with bad text on it, no matter how much effort you put in marketing your idea or solution (or both), you will fail at converting users into customers. That's the most important aspect of good design into landing page creation. Good design enables smoothly the conversion of visitors (your audience) into customers.

## What tools should people use to design their products or process?

Using a website builder such as Webflow or Versoly is an amazing starting point, there are also resources for developers such as Frontendor https://frontendor.com/ - that will allow you to quickly iterate using HTML/CSS to build quickly a page. The most important part about a page is CLARITY and COPY. 
If you can demonstrate that you fully understand your audience and you can write exactly how you can help them through compelling copy, you can sell anything!

 ## What is the process of designing landing pages or designing your site

If you don't know where to start you should download a template from a reputable source and follow their instructions. 
In general you want to always put yourself in the shoes of your audience, what do they want to know? What are their painpoints? If you can answer how you can solve their pain showing them data and how much money they're losing, you can easily assemble a winning landing page!
